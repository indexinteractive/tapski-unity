# Firebase configuration

This folder should contain two files, downloadable from the firebase console:

- [GoogleService-Info.plist](Assets/_tapski/Settings/firebase/GoogleService-Info.plist)
- [google-services.json](Assets/_tapski/Settings/firebase/google-services.json)

A third file, used for the local development environment will be generated by firebase during runtime. It is a duplicate of `google-services.json` at the following location:

- [google-services-desktop.json](Assets/StreamingAssets/google-services-desktop.json)

## Important notes

- The configuration files mentioned above should not be source controlled, unless you want additional snoopers in the database.
- If building for Linux, an additional `FirebaseCppApp-X_X_X.so` needs to be downloaded and added to the firebase plugins directory, as explained here: https://github.com/GameWorkstore/com.google.firebase.app/wiki
